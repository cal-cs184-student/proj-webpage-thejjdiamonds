          <h2>Part 1: Ray Generation and Scene Intersection</h2>
		  <p> 
			To implement ray generation, we would need to transform coordinates into the world space. Given the normalized image coordinates, inputted as <code>(x, y)</code>, we wanted to output a ray in the world space. This involved transforming the image coordinates first to camera space: 
			since we’re able to calculate the bottom left corner and the top right corner of the sensor, we’re able to find the width and height of the sensor and transform our image coordinates accordingly. To then transform it into world space, we then applied the camera-to-world 
			rotation matrix on our new found camera coordinates. Since we needed to create a new ray and return it, we found the ray direction with our new world coordinates, normalized it and passed it into the Ray’s constructor along with the camera’s position in the world.
		  </p>
		  <p>
			Once we were able to generate the ray, we then implemented <code>raytrace_pixel(...)</code>, which took in a pixel coordinate in the unnormalized image space and updated the corresponding pixel in<code>sampleBuffer</code> with the integral of radiance of the pixel. To do so, we needed to average 
			<code>ns_aa</code> samples. Each sample was generated with the method <code>get_sample()</code> - this would produce a 2D vector which we would then add to the input coordinates and normalize based on the sampleBuffer height and width. We would then pass in the normalized sample into <code>generate_ray(...)</code> 
			and then finally <code>est_radiance_global_illumination(ray)</code>. That output would be computed as part of the average and we then finally updated the pixel with <code>sampleBufer.updatepixel(...)</code>. 
			</p>
		  <p>
			To check for primitive intersection, we implemented methods to see if our ray intersected with a sphere or triangle. Generally speaking, for both implementations, we first created a function that only checked for the intersection itself and then another function that would “record” information 
			about the intersection if there was one. Both functions were done with a respective algorithm/formula, with the ray-sphere intersection implemented with a derivation of the quadratic formula and the ray-triangle intersection implemented with the Moller Trumbore Algorithm (as shown below):

		  </div>

		  <p>
			More specifically, for our triangle intersection algorithm, using the Moller Trumbore Algorithm, we were able to derive the barycentric coordinates of our point of intersection. With those barycentric coordinates, we would then check if the point of intersection was inside of the triangle on the plane - if it was, 
			we would update the maximum value of the parameter t along with the information about our intersection (the intersection’s t parameter, its surface normal, the primitive, and the surface material). 
		  </p>

		  <p>Below is an example of what the algorithm's process looks like and how the final resulting Bezier curve is produced: </p>

        <section id="task2">
          <h2>Part 2: Bounding Volume Hierarchy</h2>
		  <p>
			Our BVH construction algorithm recursively creates each node in the BVH according to the <code>max_leaf_size</code> passed in and our splitting point heuristic. The process is as follows:
			</p>
			<p>
			<ul>
				<li>First, we compute the bounding box of the entire list of primitives passed in (from the iterators <code>start</code> to <code>end</code>) and initialize a new BVHNode <code>node</code> with that bounding box.</li>
				<li>If the number of primitives in this bounding box is less than or equal to <code>max_leaf_size</code>, we simply set this new node’s <code>start</code> and <code>end</code> iterators to be the same as the ones passed in, and return node. This is our base case.</li>
				<li>Otherwise, we must start the process of splitting the primitives into two parts and creating a BVHNode for the left and right children recursively.</li>
				<ul>
					<li>Our splitting heuristic was to choose the longest axis of the current bounding box that all the primitives lie in, then split the primitives based on which half of this axis they lie on.</li>
					<li>We made a lambda function that would take in a primitive and return true if its centroid lay to the left of the midpoint of the longest bounding box axis, and false otherwise.</li>
					<li>We passed this lambda function into <code>std::partition</code>, which would sort the list in-place based on this function. It returns an iterator which we called <code>mid</code> that points to the part of the list where the primitives stop landing on one side of the axis and belong to the other.</li>
					<li>Finally, we simply made the two recursive calls to <code>BVHAccel::construct_bvh</code> on the left and right members of node, passing in the iterators <code>start</code> and <code>mid</code> for the left child, and the iterators <code>mid</code> and <code>end</code> for the right child.</li>
				</ul>
				<li>Our splitting scheme has a chance of choosing a split point such that all primitives lie on only one side of the split point. To avoid the infinite recursion of this case, we made an extra check through the iterators after <code>std::partition</code> is called to see if any part of the list has zero primitives. If we found that this was the case, we simply divided the remaining list of primitives in half, set the <code>mid</code> iterator to the middle of this list, and proceeded to the recursive calls.</li>
			</ul>
			</p>
			<p>
				After completing <code>BVHAccel::has_intersection</code> and <code>BVHAccel::intersect</code>, the following large .dae files can render in a fraction of a second:

			  </div>
			<p>
				Let us take a look at <code>dae/meshedit/cow.dae</code>, <code>dae/sky/bench.dae</code>, and <code>dae/sky/CBcoil.dae</code> to see how BVH acceleration helps render times increase. The cow took 0.1789s, the bench took 0.0539s, and the coil took 0.0680s to render with BVH. Without the BVH acceleration implemented, the cow took 40.1128s, the bench took 277.2048s, and the coil took 39.2773s! As you can see with these rendering times, Bounding Volume Hierarchies greatly enhanced the speed at which we can calculate ray-object intersections using recursion and good heuristics for partitioning objects into bounded boxes.

		  <p>
			Given our starting vertex, we first retrieved one of its halfedges. We also created a 3D vector that would keep track of the sum of our area-weighted normals. From the halfedge that we retrieved, we 
			then traversed along the current face to get the neighboring vertices of our current vertex - with these vertices, we can compute the area of a triangle by finding the cross product of two of its edges, 
			taking its norm, and then dividing by two. Because we were working with a halfedge data structure, we were able to find the normal of the current face by calling on the appropriate methods, specifically 
			accessing <code>face()</code> from the current halfedge, and <code>normal()</code> from our current face. We then found the area-weighted normals (i.e. multiplied the area of the face with its normal). This result was stored in 
			the 3D vector that would track the summation of our area-weighted normals. From here we traversed through the rest of the faces that were incident to our original starting vertex using <code>twin()</code> and aggregated 
			all our results in the 3D vector. Once we reached the original halfedge that we first started on, it gave us indication that we had finished our traversal. Finally, we normalized the sum of all area-weighted 
			normals using the in-built function <code>unit()</code>.

		<!-- Task 6 Content
		============================ -->
    <section id="task6">
          <h2>Task 6: Loop Subdivision for Mesh Upsampling</h2>
          <p>Loop subdivision is an upsampling algorithm that divides each triangle that makes up a mesh into 4 smaller triangles (4-1 subdivision), with each new triangle’s vertices weighted in 3D space appropriately. This is implemented by performing an edge split on every original edge in the mesh, and then flipping the necessary edges to create the right subdivisions.</p>
          <p>Following the recommended implementation detailed on the spec and commented in the starter code, we did the following:</p>
          <ul>
          	<li><p><strong>Compute new positions for all the vertices in the input mesh</strong>: We iterated through every vertex and marked each as not new (i.e. part of the original mesh). We then iterated through every neighboring vertex to get the sum of all original positions of the neighboring vertices. With this sum, the degree of the vertex, and the original position of the vertex, we calculated the new position of the vertex (what it will be in the subdivided mesh) and stored that value in the <code>newPosition</code> member variable. The following rule describes how the position of an existing vertex is updated:</p><p> <code>(1 - n * u) * original_position + u * original_neighbor_position_sum</code></li></p>
          	<li><p><strong>Compute the updated vertex positions associated with edges</strong>: We iterated through every edge and collected all the corresponding halfedges and vertices for the edge. Using the position of the four vertices around the two triangles that share this edge, we calculated the updated position for the vertex that would soon be added to the midpoint of this edge when edge splitting occurs. The following rule calculates this value (with A, B, C, and D being the vertex positions):</p><p><code>3/8 * (A + B) + 1/8 * (C + D)</code></p></li>
          	<li><strong>Split every edge in the mesh</strong>: We iterated through every original edge in the mesh and called <code>splitEdge()</code> on each. To ensure we only went through edges from the original mesh (and not any of the newly created edges from calling <code>splitEdge()</code>), we saved the number of edges in the original mesh before iterating, and only iterated that many times to perform the splitting operation. In <code>splitEdge</code>, we also made sure to only mark two edges as new edges, leaving the third <i>technically</i> new edge alone as it acts as part of the original edge.</li>
          	<li><strong>Flip any new edge that connects an old and new vertex</strong>: Now iterating through every edge in the mesh, we flipped any edge that was marked as new and was connected to an old vertex and a new vertex.</li>
          	<li><strong>Copy the new vertex positions into final <code>Vertex::position</code></strong>: Finally, we did one more iteration through every vertex in the mesh and updated its position variable to be the value stored in newPosition.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>After loop subdivision, sharp edges and corners become much less prominent. Corners and edges curve more, making the shape as a whole become rounder and smoother. If we want to preserve these corners and edges more during loop subdivision iterations, we can preprocess the mesh by adding more edge splits around those areas to minimize the smoothing effect.</p>
          <p>For example, doing loop subdivision on the torus with no preprocessing causes the sharp edges and corners to round out dramatically. However, if we add more edge splits around a particular corner before performing loop subdivision, the corner remains more prominent afterwards.</p>

						Asymmetric meshes will remain asymmetric even after loop subdivision. An example of this is the cube mesh, which is made up of asymmetric edges.

          <p>Comparing the cube to the icosahedron, the cube has asymmetric corners that the icosahedron does not have. To make the cube also end up with a symmetrical result, we can preprocess the original mesh symmetric by splitting the edge that is the diagonal of each face of the cube (making each of the six faces of the cube made up of four triangles instead of two).</p>
